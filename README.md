<br>In both of the 2 modes you have to eat 30 fish to win the game, and every 5 fish you eat, makes you grow!<br>
In the peace mode, you have 2 enemies: the shark which makes you lose once it eats you! and the stinky fish which makes you rotate and prevent you from eating anything.<br><img src="https://github.com/Aml-Hassan-Abd-El-hamid/Fishy-Game/blob/main/stinky.png" width="170" height="170" > Stiky fish<br>
